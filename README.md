#  Cross GAN Auditing: Unsupervised Identification of Attribute Level Similarities and Differences between Pretrained Generative Models

This repo (based off the LatentCLR repo) contains the raw code used for all experiments. It's current state is difficult to use, so please email me if you plan on running experiments and I will help you set it up. Needs `hydra-core==1.0.6` and StyleGAN2-ada legacy.py conversion code.
